            A growing fintech app seeks to streamline its onboarding and KYC
            process while meeting UK regulatory standards. The app aims to
            deliver a fast and user-friendly onboarding journey that builds user
            trust and meets AML compliance.

          Lengthy onboarding experiences requiring multiple document uploads or
          physical verification steps discourage users from completing
          registration. In competitive markets, drop-offs during KYC can lead to
          lost customers and higher acquisition costs. Manual verification also
          increases operational costs and slows down scale.
